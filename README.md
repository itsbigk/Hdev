#Homeless Devices
Designed to help people find their apple devices easier and to help people who found someones device return it to the owner.

###Basic Information
<hr>
####This was build using the MEAN stack.

####Make sure you have done the following before using: <br>
  - You must have Node.js, Bower, and MongoDB installed on your computer. <br>
  - $ npm install (to bring in all of the node modules) <br>
  - $ bower install (to add all of the bower components) <br>
  - $ mongod (if you do not have mongo already running locally on your computer)

Currently the only devices this works for iPhone, iPad, and iPod. Also the software that runs on your computer currently only has a working version for MacOS. Those files are not included here but are included in the links when using the app. The Gruntfile is currently under development.

###In Progress
<hr>
####Items that are currently in progress are: <br>
  - Adding other forms of authentication such as Facebook and Twitter. <br>
  - Developing a program for the app that works on windows based operating systems. <br>
  - Adding a mailer. <br>
  - Adding mongo methods that run when a case is created to notify the user via email if there is a matched device. <br>
  - Have the same notification mongo methods run on a schedule so the user is updated daily. <br>
  - Add server and client side testing. <br>
  - Host all downloadable files on an s3 server instead of mediafire.
